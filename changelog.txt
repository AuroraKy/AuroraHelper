Bug: If you are pause dlong enough in pause music controller on awake music it just... starts again???
Music Sync respawns?

Ideas:
[] PlayAudio has Subtitle field (does the same as subtitle trigger)

Should spider hit all things in the teleport? lol

Things to fix:
Jump input seems to not work sometimes? weird.

GD gamemodes:
X ship -> funny (hold to go up/down)
X wave -> funny (it's a wave idk)
X spider -> teleport to thing above and change gravity
x ball -> spider but no telport
"fake states"
/ cube -> hold right (but you can't hold jump to go higher ExtVar.)
/ robot -> hold right (can hold jump)
/ ufo -> hold right infinite jumps

Stuff I gotta make:
Pulse entity thing
Pulse trigger thing
draw lines connecting the blocks
