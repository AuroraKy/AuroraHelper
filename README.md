I hate false positives.

I'm not that good at coding, wouldn't particularly recommend using any of this as reference.

# Pointless Area

And that is when you find out that what you really are working for is nothing since work is not a thing that you ahve considered for a long time. What is the point of any of it if in the end nothing ends up mattering? Maybe I am just tired,m I am a little tired of walking after all. this is a song reference thata I know no one would've carttched. The song is Miku irony, I love making song references. Randomly, deliberately all the time. I often hope people understand myt referennces but I understand that the chance for it is very small. I think I might be going insane or maybe I already was inssane. AA bullet that cannot be stopped, you know? The certain downwards spiral, welcome to the mindfuck. How many of those do you think might be a song reference? It's unclear. Well, to me it is clear; There might be some accidental song references though. Thus the information is arbitrary like a shugenja sitting between two evil players. That's right it's a BOTC reference, didn't expect that. Unless you know me then you probably did I am kind of obsessed with that game right now. What a pointless waste of time to read this entire thing. I really do not recommend doijng so but I guess if you read this part you're already invested right? I would personally never stop at this point but I highly recommed you to do so. I suppose maybe if the information given was very boring I would in fact stop, and truly there is nothing here so the chance I wouldn't continue is actually closer to about 20 % than 0. Anyway I really do dislike false positives it kinda ruins the entire fun of coding it's so annoying, I am not even creating temporary files why is some temporary file apparently a virus it's so dumb.

I'm annoyed.
